Move to ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/bin and start
ng_shared_parallel_v.exe. ngspice.dll has been compiled
for 64 bit from branch pre-master and copied to 
ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/bin.
ng_shared_parallel_v.exe has been copied after compilation
from ngspice_sync\ng_shared_parallel_v\x64\Release to
ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/bin.

Compilation (tested with MS Visual Studio 2019) is available by 
activating ng_shared_parallel_v.sln in ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/.

Compilation with CYGWIN is o.k. as well. You have to manually copy 
usr/local/bin/cygngspice-0.dll to cygngspice-x.dll with x = 1, 2, 3.

Compilation under LINUX has been successfully implemented and tested.

Linux/macOS Compilation Instructions:
=====================================

1. Install dependencies:
   - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ngspice libngspice0-dev
   - CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install ngspice ngspice-devel
   - Fedora: sudo dnf install ngspice ngspice-devel
   - macOS (MacPorts): sudo port install ngspice +lib+manual
   - macOS (Homebrew): brew install ngspice

2. Build the project:
   make config    # Check configuration
   make release   # Build optimized version
   make debug     # Build debug version

3. Prepare runtime libraries:
   make prepare-libs

4. Run the test:
   ./ng_shared_parallel_test
   # or
   make test

For automated setup on Linux, use:
   ./setup_linux.sh

For compilation testing:
   ./test_compilation.sh

See README_Linux_macOS.md for detailed instructions.
