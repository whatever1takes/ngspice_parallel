Move to ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/bin and start
ng_shared_parallel_v.exe. ngspice.dll has been compiled
for 64 bit from branch pre-master and copied to 
ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/bin.
ng_shared_parallel_v.exe has been copied after compilation
from ngspice_sync\ng_shared_parallel_v\x64\Release to
ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/bin.

Compilation (tested with MS Visual Studio 2019) is available by 
activating ng_shared_parallel_v.sln in ngspice_sync/ng_shared_parallel_v/.

Compilation with CYGWIN is o.k. as well. You have to manually copy 
usr/local/bin/cygngspice-0.dll to cygngspice-x.dll with x = 1, 2, 3.

Compilation under LINUX still has to be tested.
